        <p> Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and perform tasks autonomously. AI encompasses a wide range of technologies and techniques that enable machines to exhibit intelligent behavior and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

Here are some key concepts and areas related to AI:

Machine Learning: Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on creating algorithms and models that allow computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves training models with large amounts of data to recognize patterns and make inferences.

Deep Learning: Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves building and training artificial neural networks with multiple layers to analyze and learn from data. It has been instrumental in achieving breakthroughs in areas such as image and speech </p>
